# TODOs

- Add `dx init` feature to global wrapper, in order to more conveniently set up a .dxcli installation at the given location
- Allow command shortnames
- When installing subcommands from a remote URL, add the short commit id to the resulting script filename to avoid collisions
- When running dxcli.sh with -v, show the full file path to each subcommand
- Write a README section on why & when and why & when not to use dxcli, contrast with Make
- Add shell autocomplete
